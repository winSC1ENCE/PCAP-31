    "\n",
    "**Generator** - what do you associate this word with? Perhaps it refers to some electronic device. Or perhaps it refers to a heavy and serious machine designed to produce power, electrical or other.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python generator is **a piece of specialized code able to produce a series of values, and to control the iteration process**. This is why generators are very often called **iterators**, and although some may find a very subtle distinction between these two, we'll treat them as one.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not realize it, but you've encountered generators many, many times before. Take a look at the very simple snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function is, in fact, a generator, which is (in fact, again) an iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "A function returns one, well-defined value - it may be the result of a more or less complex evaluation of, e.g., a polynomial, and is invoked once - only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator **returns a series of values**, and in general, is (implicitly) invoked more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, the `range()` generator is invoked six times, providing five subsequent values from zero to four, and finally signaling that the series is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above process is completely transparent. Let's shed some light on it. Let's show you the **iterator protocol**.\n"

    "The **iterator protocol is a way in which an object should behave to conform to the rules imposed by the context of the `for` and `in` statements**. An object conforming to the iterator protocol is called an **iterator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator must provide two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `__iter__()` which should **return the object itself** and which is invoked once (it's needed for Python to successfully start the iteration)\n",
    "-   `__next__()` which is intended to **return the next value** (first, second, and so on) of the desired series - it will be invoked by the `for`/`in` statements in order to pass through the next iteration; if there are no more values to provide, the method should **raise the `StopIteration` exception**.\n",

    "\n",
    "-   lines 8 through 10: the `__iter__` method is obliged to return the iterator object itself; its purpose may be a bit ambiguous here, but there's no mystery; try to imagine an object which is not an iterator (e.g., it's a collection of some entities), but one of its components is an iterator able to scan the collection; the `__iter__` method should **extract the iterator and entrust it with the execution of the iteration protocol**; as you can see, the method starts its action by printing a message;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   lines 12 through 21: the `__next__` method is responsible for creating the sequence; it's somewhat wordy, but this should make it more readable; first, it prints a message, then it updates the number of desired values, and if it reaches the end of the sequence, the method breaks the iteration by raising the StopIteration exception; the rest of the code is simple, and it precisely reflects the definition we showed you earlier;\n",

    "### The yield statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterator protocol isn't particularly difficult to understand and use, but it is also indisputable that the **protocol is rather inconvenient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main discomfort it brings is **the need to save the state of the iteration between subsequent `__iter__` invocations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `Fib` iterator is forced to precisely store the place in which the last invocation has been stopped (i.e., the evaluated number and the values of the two previous elements). This makes the code larger and less comprehensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why Python offers a much more effective, convenient, and elegant way of writing iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is fundamentally based on a very specific and powerful mechanism provided by the `yield` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think of the `yield` keyword as a smarter sibling of the `return` statement, with one essential difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fun(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        return i\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks strange, doesn't it? It's clear that the `for` loop has no chance to finish its first execution, as the `return` will break it irrevocably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, invoking the function won't change anything - the `for` loop will start from scratch and will be broken immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say that such a function is not able to save and restore its state between subsequent invocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that a function like this **cannot be used as a generator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've replaced exactly one word in the code - can you see it?\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def fun(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        yield i\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've added `yield` instead of `return`. This little amendment **turns the function into a generator**, and executing the `yield` statement has some very interesting effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, it provides the value of the expression specified after the `yield` keyword, just like `return`, but doesn't lose the state of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the variables' values are frozen, and wait for the next invocation, when the execution is resumed (not taken from scratch, like after `return`).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one important limitation: such a **function should not be invoked explicitly** as - in fact - it isn't a function anymore; **it's a generator object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The invocation will **return the object's identifier**, not the series we expect from the generator.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `lambda` function is a concept borrowed from mathematics, more specifically, from a part called _the Lambda calculus_, but these two phenomena are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematicians use _the Lambda calculus_ in many formal systems connected with logic, recursion, or theorem provability. Programmers use the `lambda` function to simplify the code, to make it clearer and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `lambda` function is a function without a name (you can also call it **an anonymous function**). Of course, such a statement immediately raises the question: how do you use anything that cannot be identified?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, it's not a problem, as you can name such a function if you really need, but, in fact, in many cases the `lambda` function can exist and work while remaining fully incognito.\n",
    "\n",
    "The declaration of the `lambda` function doesn't resemble a normal function declaration in any way - see for yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "`lambda parameters: expression`\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a clause **returns the value of the expression when taking into account the current value of the current `lambda` argument**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, an example will be helpful. Our example uses three `lambda` functions, but gives them names. Look at it carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "two = lambda: 2\n",
    "sqr = lambda x: x * x\n",
    "pwr = lambda x, y: x ** y\n",
    "\n",
    "for a in range(-2, 3):\n",
    "    print(sqr(a), end=\" \")\n",
    "    print(pwr(a, two()))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analzye it:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   the first `lambda` is an anonymous **parameterless function** that always returns `2`. As we've **assigned it to a variable named `two`**, we can say that the function is not anonymous anymore, and we can use the name to invoke it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   the second one is a **one-parameter anonymous function** that returns the value of its squared argument. We've named it as such, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   the third `lambda` **takes two parameters** and returns the value of the first one raised to the power of the second one. The name of the variable which carries the `lambda` speaks for itself. We don't use `pow` to avoid confusion with the built-in function of the same name and the same purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The program produces the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "`4 4 1 1 0 0 1 1 4 4`\n",
    "\n",
    "**output**\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is clear enough to show how `lambda`s are declared and how they behave, but it says nothing about why they're necessary, and what they're used for, since they can all be replaced with routine Python functions.\n",

    "### How to use lambdas and what for?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most interesting part of using lambdas appears when you can use them in their pure form - **as anonymous parts of code intended to evaluate a result**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we need a function (we'll name it `print_function`) which prints the values of a given (other) function for a set of selected arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want `print_function` to be universal - it should accept a set of arguments put in a list and a function to be evaluated, both as arguments - we don't want to hardcode anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the example in the editor. This is how we've implemented the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze it. The `print_function()` function takes two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   the first, a list of arguments for which we want to print the results;\n",
    "-   the second, a function which should be invoked as many times as the number of values that are collected inside the first parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we've also defined a function named `poly()` - this is the function whose values we're going to print. The calculation the function performs isn't very sophisticated - it's the polynomial (hence its name) of a form:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = 2x<sup>2</sup> - 4x + 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the function is then passed to the `print_function()` along with a set of five different arguments - the set is built with a list comprehension clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code prints the following lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "`f(-2)=18 f(-1)=8 f(0)=2 f(1)=0 f(2)=2`\n",
    "\n",
    "**output**\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we avoid defining the `poly()` function, as we're not going to use it more than once? Yes, we can - this is the benefit a lambda can bring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the example below. Can you see the difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "`def print_function(args, fun):`\n",
    "\n",
    "`for x in args:`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print('f(', x,')=', fun(x), sep='')`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print_function([x for x in range(-2, 3)], lambda x: 2 * x**2 - 4 * x + 2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print_function()` has remained exactly the same, but there is no `poly()` function. We don't need it anymore, as the polynomial is now directly inside the `print_function()` invocation in the form of a lambda defined in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "`lambda x: 2 * x**2 - 4 * x + 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "The code has become shorter, clearer, and more legible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us show you another place where lambdas can be useful. We'll start with a description of `map()`, a built-in Python function. Its name isn't too descriptive, its idea is simple, and the function itself is really usable."

    "### Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. A file needs to be **open** before it can be processed by a program, and it should be **closed** when the processing is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening the file associates it with the **stream**, which is an abstract representation of the physical data stored on the media. The way in which the stream is processed is called **open mode**. **Three** open modes exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **read mode** – only read operations are allowed;\n",
    "-   **write mode** – only write operations are allowed;\n",
    "-   **update mode** – both writes and reads are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Depending on the physical file content, different Python classes can be used to process files. In general, the `BufferedIOBase` is able to process any file, while `TextIOBase` is a specialized class dedicated to processing text files (i.e. files containing human-visible texts divided into lines using new-line markers). Thus, the streams can be divided into **binary** and **text** ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. The following `open()` function syntax is used to open a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "`open(file_name, mode=open_mode, encoding=text_encoding)`\n",
    "The invocation creates a stream object and associates it with the file named `file_name`, using the specified `open_mode` and setting the specified `text_encoding`, or it **raises an exception in the case of an error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Three **predefined** streams are already open when the program starts:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `sys.stdin` – standard input;\n",
    "-   `sys.stdout` – standard output;\n",
    "-   `sys.stderr` – standard error output.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. The `IOError` exception object, created when any file operations fails (including open operations), contains a property named `errno`, which contains the completion code of the failed action. Use this value to diagnose the problem.\n"

    "-   `read(number)` – reads the `number` characters/bytes from the file and returns them as a string; is able to read the whole file at once;\n",
    "-   `readline()` – reads a single line from the text file;\n",
    "-   `readlines(number)` – reads the `number` lines from the text file; is able to read all lines at once;\n",
    "-   `readinto(bytearray)` – reads the bytes from the file and fills the `bytearray` with them;\n",

    "\n",
    "-   `write(string)` – writes a `string` to a text file;\n",
    "-   `write(bytearray)` – writes all the bytes of `bytearray` to a file;\n",

    "\n",

    "-   **version** — stores the operating system version;\n",

    "-   **nt** — you'll get this name if you use Windows;\n",

    "### Creating directories in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The _os_ module provides a function called _mkdir_, which, like the _mkdir_ command in Unix and Windows, allows you to create a directory. The _mkdir_ function requires a path that can be relative or absolute. Let's recall what both paths look like in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **my\\_first\\_directory** — this is a relative path which will create the _my\\_first\\_directory_ directory in the current working directory;\n",
    "-   **./my\\_first\\_directory** — this is a relative path that explicitly points to the current working directory. It has the same effect as the path above;\n",
    "-   **../my\\_first\\_directory** — this is a relative path that will create the _my\\_first\\_directory_ directory in the parent directory of the current working directory;\n",
    "-   **/python/my\\_first\\_directory** — this is the absolute path that will create the _my\\_first\\_directory_ directory, which in turn is in the _python_ directory in the root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the code in the editor. It shows an example of how to create the _my\\_first\\_directory_ directory using a relative path. This is the simplest variant of the relative path, which consists of passing only the directory name.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you test your code here, it will output the newly created `['my_first_directory']` directory (and the entire content of the current working catalog).\n",
    "\n",
    "The _mkdir_ function creates a directory in the specified path. Note that running the program twice will raise a _FileExistsError_.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we cannot create a directory if it already exists. In addition to the path argument, the _mkdir_ function can optionally take the _mode_ argument, which specifies directory permissions. However, on some systems, the _mode_ argument is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the directory permissions, we recommend the _chmod_ function, which works similarly to the _chmod_ command on Unix systems. You can find more information about it in the documentation.\n",

    "In the above example, another function provided by the _os_ module named _listdir_ is used. The _listdir_ function returns a list containing the names of the files and directories that are in the path passed as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no argument is passed to it, the current working directory will be used (as in the example above). It's important that the result of the _listdir_ function omits the entries '.' and '..', which are displayed, e.g., when using the _ls -a_ command on Unix systems.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It goes without saying that operating systems allow you to search for files and directories. While studying this part of the course, you learned about the functions of the _os_ module, which have everything you need to write a program that will search for directories in a given location.\n",

    "Your program should meet the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Write a function or method called _find_ that takes two arguments called _path_ and _dir_. The _path_ argument should accept a relative or absolute path to a directory where the search should start, while the _dir_ argument should be the name of a directory that you want to find in the given path. Your program should display the absolute paths if it finds a directory with the given name.\n",

    "### Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. The `uname` function returns an object that contains information about the current operating system. The object has the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   _systemname_ (stores the name of the operating system)\n",
    "-   _nodename_ (stores the machine name on the network)\n",
    "-   _release_ (stores the operating system release)\n",
    "-   _version_ (stores the operating system version)\n",
    "-   _machine_ (stores the hardware identifier, e.g. x86\\_64.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. The _name_ attribute available in the `os` module allows you to distinguish the operating system. It returns one of the following three values:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   _posix_ (you'll get this name if you use Unix)\n",
    "-   _nt_ (you'll get this name if you use Windows)\n",
    "-   _java_ (you'll get this name if your code is written in something like Jython)\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. The `mkdir` function creates a directory in the path passed as its argument. The path can be either relative or absolute, e.g:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import os`\n",
    "\n",
    "`os.mkdir(\"hello\") # the relative path`\n",
    "\n",
    "`os.mkdir(\"/home/python/hello\") # the absolute path`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If the directory exists, a `FileExistsError` exception will be thrown. In addition to the `mkdir` function, the `os` module provides the `makedirs` function, which allows you to recursively create all directories in a path.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. The result of the `listdir()` function is a list containing the names of the files and directories that are in the path passed as its argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that the `listdir` function omits the entries '.' and '..', which are displayed, for example, when using the `ls -a` command on Unix systems. If the path isn't passed, the result will be returned for the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. To move between directories, you can use a function called `chdir()`, which changes the current working directory to the specified path. As its argument, it takes any relative or absolute path.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to find out what the current working directory is, you can use the `getcwd()` function, which returns the path to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. To remove a directory, you can use the `rmdir()` function, but to remove a directory and its subdirectories, use the `removedirs()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "7\\. On both Unix and Windows, you can use the system function, which executes a command passed to it as a string, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import os`\n",
    "\n",
    "`returned_value = os.system(\"mkdir hello\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "The system function on Windows returns the value returned by shell after running the command given, while on Unix it returns the exit status of the process."

    "-   **data validation** — you'll soon learn how to read the current date and time in Python. Knowing the current date and time, we're able to validate various types of data, e.g., whether a discount coupon entered by a user in our application is still valid;\n",
    "-   **storing important information** — can you imagine bank transfers without storing the information of when they were made? The date and time of certain actions must be preserved, and we must deal with it.\n",

    "### Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. To create a `date` object, you must pass the year, month, and day arguments as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from datetime import date`\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_date = date(2020, 9, 29)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(\"Year:\", my_date.year) # Year: 2020`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(\"Month:\", my_date.month) # Month: 9`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(\"Day:\", my_date.day) # Day: 29`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `date` object has three (read-only) attributes: year, month, and day.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. The `today` method returns a date object representing the current local date:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from datetime import date`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(\"Today:\", date.today()) # Displays: Today: 2020-09-29`\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. In Unix, the timestamp expresses the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC). This date is called the \"Unix epoch\", because it began the counting of time on Unix systems. The timestamp is actually the difference between a particular date (including time) and January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC), expressed in seconds. To create a date object from a timestamp, we must pass a Unix timestamp to the `fromtimestamp` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from datetime import date`\n",
    "\n",
    "`import time`\n",
    "\n",
    "`timestamp = time.time()`\n",
    "\n",
    "`d = date.fromtimestamp(timestamp)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The `time` function returns the number of seconds from January 1, 1970 to the current moment in the form of a float number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. The constructor of the `time` class accepts six arguments (_hour_, _minute_, _second_, _microsecond_, _tzinfo_, and _fold_). Each of these arguments is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "`from datetime import time`\n",
    "\n",
    "`t = time(13, 22, 20)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(\"Hour:\", t.hour) # Hour: 13`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(\"Minute:\", t.minute) # Minute: 22`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(\"Second:\", t.second) # Second: 20`\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. The `time` module contains the `sleep` function, which suspends program execution for a given number of seconds, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import time`\n",
    "\n",
    "`time.sleep(10)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(\"Hello world!\") # This text will be displayed after 10 seconds.`\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. In the `datetime` module, date and time can be represented either as separate objects, or as one object. The class that combines date and time is called _datetime_. All arguments passed to the constructor go to read-only class attributes. They are _year_, _month_, _day_, _hour_, _minute_, _second_, _microsecond_, _tzinfo_, and _fold_:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from datetime import datetime`\n",
    "\n",
    "`dt = datetime(2020, 9, 29, 13, 51)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(\"Datetime:\", dt) # Displays: Datetime: 2020-09-29 13:51:00`\n",
    "\n",
    "7\\. The `strftime` method takes only one argument in the form of a string specifying a format that can consist of directives. A directive is a string consisting of the character `%` (percent) and a lower-case or upper-case letter. Below are some useful directives:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "One of them is of course displaying the calendar. It's important that the days of the week are displayed from Monday to Sunday, and each day of the week has its representation in the form of an integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Day of the week | Integer value | Constant |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Monday | 0 | `calendar.MONDAY` |\n",

    "| Wednesday | 2 | `calendar.WEDNESDAY` |\n",
    "| Thursday | 3 | `calendar.THURSDAY` |\n",
    "| Friday | 4 | `calendar.FRIDAY` |\n",
    "| Saturday | 5 | `calendar.SATURDAY` |\n",
    "| Sunday | 6 | `calendar.SUNDAY` |\n",
    "\n",
    "The table above shows the representation of the days of the week in the `calendar` module. The first day of the week (Monday) is represented by the value _0_ and the _calendar.MONDAY_ constant, while the last day of the week (Sunday) is represented by the value _6_ and the _calendar.SUNDAY_ constant.\n",

    "### Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. In the `calendar` module, the days of the week are displayed from Monday to Sunday. Each day of the week has its representation in the form of an integer, where the first day of the week (Monday) is represented by the value 0, while the last day of the week (Sunday) is represented by the value 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. To display a calendar for any year, call the `calendar` function with the year passed as its argument, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import calendar`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(calendar.calendar(2020))`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A good alternative to the above function is the function called `prcal`, which also takes the same parameters as the `calendar` function, but doesn't require the use of the `print` function to display the calendar.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. To display a calendar for any month of the year, call the `month` function, passing year and month to it. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import calendar`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(calendar.month(2020, 9))`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You can also use the `prmonth` function, which has the same parameters as the `month` function, but doesn't require the use of the `print` function to display the calendar.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. The `setfirstweekday` function allows you to change the first day of the week. It takes a value from 0 to 6, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. The result of the `weekday` function is a day of the week as an integer value for a given year, month, and day:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import calendar`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(calendar.weekday(2020, 9, 29)) # This displays 1, which means Tuesday.`\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. The `weekheader` function returns the weekday names in a shortened form. The `weekheader` method requires you to specify the width in characters for one day of the week. If the width you provide is greater than 3, you'll still get the abbreviated weekday names consisting of only three characters. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import calendar`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(calendar.weekheader(2)) # This display: Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su`\n",
    "\n",
    "7\\. A very useful function available in the `calendar` module is the function called `isleap`, which, as the name suggests, allows you to check whether the year is a leap year or not:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import calendar`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(calendar.isleap(2020)) # This displays: True`\n",
    "\n",
    "8\\. You can create a `calendar` object yourself using the `Calendar` class, which, when creating its object, allows you to change the first day of the week with the optional `firstweekday` parameter, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import calendar`\n",
    "\n",
    "`c = calendar.Calendar(2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`for weekday in c.iterweekdays():`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(weekday, end=\" \")`\n",
    "\n",
    "`# Result: 2 3 4 5 6 0 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `iterweekdays` returns an iterator for weekday numbers. The first value returned is always equal to the value of the `firstweekday` property.\n",
