   "source": [
    "**Key takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you want to import a module as a whole, you can do it using the import module_name statement. You are allowed to import more than one module at once using a comma-separated list. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import mod1\n",
    "import mod2, mod3, mod4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "although the latter form is not recommended due to stylistic reasons, and it's better and prettier to express the same intention in more a verbose and explicit form, such as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import mod2\n",
    "import mod3\n",
    "import mod4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If a module is imported in the above manner and you want to access any of its entities, you need to prefix the entity's name using dot notation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import my_module\n",
    "\n",
    "result = my_module.my_function(my_module.my_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The snippet makes use of two entities coming from the my_module module: a function named my_function() and a variable named my_data. Both names must be prefixed by my_module. None of the imported entity names conflicts with the identical names existing in your code's namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You are allowed not only to import a module as a whole, but to import only individual entities from it. In this case, the imported entities must not be prefixed when used. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from module import my_function, my_data\n",
    "\n",
    "result = my_function(my_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above way - despite its attractiveness - is not recommended because of the danger of causing conflicts with names derived from importing the code's namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The most general form of the above statement allows you to import all entities offered by a module:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from my_module import *\n",
    "\n",
    "result = my_function(my_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: this import's variant is not recommended due to the same reasons as previously (the threat of a naming conflict is even more dangerous here).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You can change the name of the imported entity \"on the fly\" by using the as phrase of the import. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from module import my_function as fun, my_data as dat\n",
    "\n",
    "result = fun(dat)\n",
