    "### The basic concepts of the object-oriented approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a step outside of computer programming and computers in general, and discuss object programming issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly all of the programs and techniques you have used till now fall under the procedural style of programming. Admittedly, you have made use of some built-in objects, but when referring to them, we just mentioned the absolute minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedural style of programming was the dominant approach to software development for decades of IT, and it is still in use today. Moreover, it isn't going to disappear in the future, as it works very well for specific types of projects (generally, not very complex ones and not large ones, but there are lots of exceptions to that rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "The object approach is quite young (much younger than the procedural approach) and is particularly useful when applied to big and complex projects carried out by large teams consisting of many developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of understanding of a project's structure makes many important tasks easier, e.g., dividing the project into small, independent parts, and independent development of different project elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is a universal tool for both object and procedural programming**. It may be successfully utilized in both spheres.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, you can create lots of useful applications, even if you know nothing about classes and objects, but you have to keep in mind that some of the problems (e.g., graphical user interface handling) may require a strict object approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, object programming is relatively simple.\n",

    "### Procedural vs. the object-oriented approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **procedural approach**, it's possible to distinguish two different and completely separate worlds: **the world of data, and the world of code**. The world of data is populated with variables of different kinds, while the world of code is inhabited by code grouped into modules and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are able to use data, but not vice versa. Furthermore, functions are able to abuse data, i.e., to use the value in an unauthorized manner (e.g., when the sine function gets a bank account balance as a parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "We said in the past that data cannot use functions. But is this entirely true? Are there some special kinds of data that can use functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there are - the ones named methods. These are functions which are invoked from within the data, not beside them. If you can see this distinction, you've taken the first step into object programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **object approach** suggests a completely different way of thinking. The data and the code are enclosed together in the same world, divided into classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every **class is like a recipe which can be used when you want to create a useful object** (this is where the name of the approach comes from). You may produce as many objects as you need to solve your problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object has a set of traits (they are called properties or attributes - we'll use both words synonymously) and is able to perform a set of activities (which are called methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "The recipes may be modified if they are inadequate for specific purposes and, in effect, new classes may be created. These new classes inherit properties and methods from the originals, and usually add some new ones, creating new, more specific tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects are incarnations** of ideas expressed in classes, like a cheesecake on your plate is an incarnation of the idea expressed in a recipe printed in an old cookbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objects interact with each other, exchanging data or activating their methods. A properly constructed class (and thus, its objects) are able to protect the sensible data and hide it from unauthorized modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no clear border between data and code: they live as one in objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these concepts are not as abstract as you may at first suspect. On the contrary, they all are taken from real-life experiences, and therefore are extremely useful in computer programming: they don't create artificial life - **they reflect real facts, relationships, and circumstances**.\n",

    "Let's look for a moment at vehicles. All existing vehicles (and those that don't exist yet) are **related by a single, important feature**: the ability to move. You may argue that a dog moves, too; is a dog a vehicle? No, it isn't. We have to improve the definition, i.e., enrich it with other criteria, distinguishing vehicles from other beings, and creating a stronger connection. Let's take the following circumstances into consideration: vehicles are artificially created entities used for transportation, moved by forces of nature, and directed (driven) by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this definition, a dog is not a vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _vehicles_ class is very broad. Too broad. We have to define some more **specialized classes**, then. The specialized classes are the **subclasses**. The _vehicles_ class will be a **superclass** for them all.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: **the hierarchy grows from top to bottom, like tree roots, not branches**. The most general, and the widest, class is always at the top (the superclass) while its descendants are located below (the subclasses).\n",

    "-   land vehicles;\n",
    "-   water vehicles;\n",
    "-   air vehicles;\n",
    "-   space vehicles.\n",

    "### What is an object?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class (among other definitions) is a **set of objects**. An object is **a being belonging to a class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is **an incarnation of the requirements, traits, and qualities assigned to a specific class**. This may sound simple, but note the following important circumstances. Classes form a hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may mean that an object belonging to a specific class belongs to all the superclasses at the same time. It may also mean that any object belonging to a superclass may not belong to any of its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: any personal car is an object belonging to the _wheeled vehicles_ class. It also means that the same car belongs to all superclasses of its home class; therefore, it is a member of the _vehicles_ class, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your dog (or your cat) is an object included in the _domesticated mammals_ class, which explicitly means that it is included in the _animals_ class as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **subclass is more specialized** (or more specific) than its superclass. Conversely, each **superclass is more general** (more abstract) than any of its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we've presumed that a class may only have one superclass - this is not always true, but we'll discuss this issue more a bit later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define one of the fundamental concepts of object programming, named **inheritance**. Any object bound to a specific level of a class hierarchy **inherits all the traits (as well as the requirements and qualities) defined inside any of the superclasses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object's home class may define new traits (as well as requirements and qualities) which will be inherited by any of its subclasses.\n",

    "\n",
    "The object programming convention assumes that **every existing object may be equipped with three groups of attributes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   an object has a **name** that uniquely identifies it within its home namespace (although there may be some anonymous objects, too)\n",
    "-   an object has a **set of individual properties** which make it original, unique, or outstanding (although it's possible that some objects may have no properties at all)\n",

    "### Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. A **class** is an idea (more or less abstract) which can be used to create a number of incarnations – such an incarnation is called an **object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. When a class is derived from another class, their relation is named **inheritance**. The class which derives from the other class is named a **subclass**. The second side of this relation is named **superclass**. A way to present such a relation is an **inheritance diagram**, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   superclasses are always presented **above** their subclasses;\n",
    "-   relations between classes are shown as arrows directed **from the subclass toward its superclass**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Objects are equipped with:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   a **name** which identifies them and allows us to distinguish between them;\n",
    "-   a set of **properties** (the set can be empty)\n",
    "-   a set of **methods** (can be empty, too)\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. To define a Python class, you need to use the `class` keyword. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`class This_Is_A_Class:`\n",
    "\n",
    "`pass`\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. To create an object of the previously defined class, you need to use the class as if it were a function. For example:\n",

    "`this_is_an_object = This_Is_A_Class()`\n",

    "\n",
    "-   the essential variable (the stack list) is highly **vulnerable**; anyone can modify it in an uncontrollable way, destroying the stack, in effect; this doesn't mean that it's been done maliciously - on the contrary, it may happen as a result of carelessness, e.g., when somebody confuses variable names; imagine that you have accidentally written something like this:\n",
    "    The functioning of the stack will be completely disorganized;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   it may also happen that one day you need more than one stack; you'll have to create another list for the stack's storage, and probably other `push` and `pop` functions too;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   it may also happen that you need not only `push` and `pop` functions, but also some other conveniences; you could certainly implement them, but try to imagine what would happen if you had dozens of separately implemented stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective approach delivers solutions for each of the above problems. Let's name them first:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   the ability to hide (protect) selected values against unauthorized access is called **encapsulation; the encapsulated values can be neither accessed nor modified if you want to use them exclusively**;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   when you have a class implementing all the needed stack behaviors, you can produce as many stacks as you want; you needn't copy or replicate any part of the code;\n",

    "-   it has to have **at least one parameter** (we'll discuss this later); the parameter is used to represent the newly created object - you can use the parameter to manipulate the object, and to enrich it with the needed properties; you'll make use of this soon;\n",
    "-   note: the obligatory parameter is usually named `self` - it's only **a convention, but you should follow it** - it simplifies the process of reading and understanding your code.\n",

    "-   we want the `pop` function not only to pop the value off the stack but also to subtract the value from the `sum` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, let's add a new variable to the class. It'll be a **private variable**, like the stack list. We don't want anybody to manipulate the `sum` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you already know, adding a new property to the class is done by the constructor. You already know how to do that, but there is something really intriguing inside the constructor. Take a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class AddingStack(Stack):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        Stack.__init__(self)\n",
    "        self.__sum = 0\n",

    "\n",
    "But the line before it looks different. What does it do? Is it really necessary? Yes, it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to many other languages, Python forces you to **explicitly invoke a superclass's constructor**. Omitting this point will have harmful effects - the object will be deprived of the `__stack_list` list. Such a stack will not function properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the only time you can invoke any of the available constructors explicitly - it can be done inside the subclass's constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   you specify the superclass's name (this is the class whose constructor you want to run)\n",

    "-   you specify the name of the constructor;\n",
    "-   you have to point to the object (the class's instance) which has to be initialized by the constructor - this is why you have to specify the argument and use the `self` variable here; note: **invoking any method (including constructors) from outside the class never requires you to put the `self` argument at the argument's list** - invoking a method from within the class demands explicit usage of the `self` argument, and it has to be put first on the list.\n",

    "### Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. A **stack** is an object designed to store data using the **LIFO** model. The stack usually performs at least two operations, named **push()** and **pop()**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Implementing the stack in a procedural model raises several problems which can be solved by the techniques offered by **OOP** (**O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming):\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. A class **method** is actually a function declared inside the class and able to access all the class's components.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. The part of the Python class responsible for creating new objects is called the **constructor**, and it's implemented as a method of the name `__init__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Each class method declaration must contain at least one parameter (always the first one) usually referred to as `self`, and is used by the objects to identify themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. If we want to hide any of a class's components from the outside world, we should start its name with `__`. Such components are called **private**.\n",

    "1\\. An **instance variable** is a property whose existence depends on the creation of an object. Every object can have a different set of instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, they can be freely added to and removed from objects during their lifetime. All object instance variables are stored inside a dedicated dictionary named `__dict__`, contained in every object separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. An instance variable can be private when its name starts with `__`, but don't forget that such a property is still accessible from outside the class using a **mangled name** constructed as `_ClassName__PrivatePropertyName`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. A **class variable** is a property which exists in exactly one copy, and doesn't need any created object to be accessible. Such variables are not shown as `__dict__` content.\n",
    "\n",
    "All a class's class variables are stored inside a dedicated dictionary named `__dict__`, contained in every class separately.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Sample()\n",
    "obj.beta = 2  # Another instance variable (existing only inside the \"obj\" instance.)\n",

    "\n",
    "In other words, inheritance is **a way of building a new class, not from scratch, but by using an already defined repertoire of traits**. The new class inherits (and this is the key) all the already existing equipment, but is able to add some new ones if needed.\n",

It's nothing extraordinary (it's just a consequence of the general rules presented earlier), but remembering it may be key to understanding how some codes work, and how the effect may be used to build a flexible set of classes.\n",

    "Take a look at the code in the editor. Let's analyze it:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   there are two classes, named `One` and `Two`, while `Two` is derived from `One`. Nothing special. However, one thing looks remarkable - the `do_it()` method.\n",

    "\n",
    "The question is - which of the two methods will be invoked by the last two lines of the code?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first invocation seems to be simple, and it is simple, actually - invoking `doanything()` from the object named `one` will obviously activate the first of the methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second invocation needs some attention. It's simple, too if you keep in mind how Python finds class components. The second invocation will launch `do_it()` in the form existing inside the `Two` class, regardless of the fact that the invocation takes place within the `One` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In effect, the code produces the following output:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It can be said that:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **inheritance extends a class's capabilities** by adding new components and modifying existing ones; in other words, the complete recipe is contained inside the class itself and all its ancestors; the object takes all the class's belongings and makes use of them;\n",

The previous approach led us to a hierarchy of classes in which the top-most class was aware of the general rules used in turning the vehicle, but didn't know how to control the appropriate components (wheels or tracks).\n",
    "\n",
    "The subclasses implemented this ability by introducing specialized mechanisms. Let's do (almost) the same thing, but using composition. The class - like in the previous example - is aware of how to turn the vehicle, but the actual turn is done by a specialized object stored in a property named `controller`.

    "### What is Method Resolution Order (MRO) and why is it that not all inheritances make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "MRO, in general, is a way (you can call it a **strategy**) in which a particular programming language scans through the upper part of a class’s hierarchy in order to find the method it currently needs. It's worth emphasizing that different languages use slightly (or even completely) different MROs. Python is a unique creature in this respect, however, and its customs are a bit specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to show you how Python's MRO works in two peculiar cases that are clear-cut examples of problems which may occur when you try to use multiple inheritance too recklessly. Let's start with a snippet that initially may look simple. Look at what we've prepared for you in the editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're sure that if you analyze the snippet yourself, you won't see any anomalies in it. Yes, you're perfectly right - it looks clear and simple, and raises no concerns. If you run the code, it will produce the following, predictable output:\n",
    "\n",
    "`bottom middle top`\n",
    "\n",
    "**output**\n",
    "\n",
    "No surprises so far. Let's make a tiny change to this code. Have a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Top:\n",
    "    def m_top(self):\n",
    "        print(\"top\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Middle(Top):\n",
    "    def m_middle(self):\n",
    "        print(\"middle\")\n",

    "\n",
    "Can you see the difference? It's hidden in this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "`class Bottom(Middle, Top):`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exotic way, we've turned a very simple code with a clear single-inheritance path into a mysterious multiple-inheritance riddle. “Is it valid?” you may ask. Yes, it is. “How is that possible?” you should ask now, and we hope that you really feel the need to ask this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the order in which the two superclasses have been listed between parenthesis is compliant with the code's structure: the `Middle` class precedes the `Top` class, just like in the real inheritance path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its oddity, the sample is correct and works as expected, but it has to be stated that this notation doesn’t bring any new functionality or additional meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's modify the code once again - now we'll swap both superclass names in the `Bottom` class definition. This is what the snippet looks like now:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Top:\n",
    "    def m_top(self):\n",
    "        print(\"top\")\n",

    "To anticipate your question, we’ll say that this amendment has spoiled the code, and it won't run anymore. What a pity.

To make it more spectacular, we've also printed the object itself, along with the result of the `__str__()` invocation.\n",

    "1\\. The `else:` branch of the `try` statement is executed when there has been no exception during the execution of the `try:` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. The `finally:` branch of the `try` statement is **always** executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. The syntax `except _Exception_Name_ as an _exception_object_:` lets you intercept an object carrying information about a pending exception. The object's property named `args` (a tuple) stores all arguments passed to the object's constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. The exception classes can be extended to enrich them with new capabilities, or to adopt their traits to newly defined exceptions.\n",
